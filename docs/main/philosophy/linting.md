Our linting and auto-fixing strategy leverages a Megabyte Labs-maintained collection of shared configurations. The collection is branded as [Strict Lint](https://strictlint.com) and includes an implementation that automatically lints and auto-fixes code when developers use the `git commit` command. It accomplishes this by leveraging git hooks.
